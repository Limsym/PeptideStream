Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, hemolysis, edema, antibacterial and antiparasitic activities (By similarity). In addition, this protein induces apoptosis. It also interacts with endothelial cells, and inhibits collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. L-LAAO family effects on platelets are controversial, since it either induces aggregation or inhibits agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions.

PMAP can bee found in various types.  Function: AM and PAMP are potent hypotensive and vasodilatator agents. Numerous actions have been reported most related to the physiologic control of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. In the kidney, am is diuretic and natriuretic, and both am and pamp inhibit aldosterone secretion by direct adrenal actions. In pituitary gland, both peptides at physiologically relevant doses inhibit basal ACTH secretion. Both peptides appear to act in brain and pituitary gland to facilitate the loss of plasma volume, actions which complement their hypotensive effects in blood vessels. PAMP can acts as an potent antimicrobial peptide which is more selective than melittin, and antimicrobial action of PAMP seems to exert via an intracellular target.

Many factors can strongly affect the efficacy of antifungal peptides. For example, disulfide bonds can help to increase potency of the oxidized form of NCR044. For deployment of NCR044 in crop protection, one could envisage further manipulating the cationicity/hydrophobicity of the oxidized or reduced NCR044 through site-directed mutagenesis and increase its antifungal potency on the surface of plant tissues without causing phytotoxicity.

"Function: Amphipathic peptide that shows bradykinin potentiating activity and antimicrobial activities against bacteria and fungi. Has higher antibacterial activities against Gram-negative than against Gram-positive bacteria. Also inhibits NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production (IC50 is 0.4 µM on granulocytes stimulated with PMA, IC50 is 0.51 µM on HL-60 cells undifferentiated and IC50 is 0.53 µM on HL-60 cells treated with DMSO). The C-terminal peptide shows a higher bradykinin potentiating activity than the complete peptide.
Tissue specificity: Expressed by the venom gland.
Miscellaneous: Shows hemolytic activity. Shows a alpha-helical structure. The genomic DNA coding for this protein is not a continuous sequence in the genome. The transcript of this protein may be generated by trans-splicing, by which exons from two independently transcribed pre-mRNAs are joined to form a single mature transcript."

It was found that GS was active against gram-negative microorganisms in the solution-based  assay, but inactive against these using an agar-based  assay.

"Function: Probably participates in a plant defense mechanism. Has antibiotic activity. Has a diuretic effect. Has a uterotonic effect in humans. Active against the Gram-positive S. aureus. Relatively ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Inhibitory effect on the growth and development of larvae from H. punctigera. The unmodified form has hemolytic activity, the oxidized form lacks hemolytic activity. If the protein is linearized, hemolytic activity is lost.
MOA: a small number of cyclotides bind to the membrane surface and then insert first into the outer membrane leaflet followed by penetration through the membrane and pore formation. At higher concentrations of cyclotides, destabilization of membranes occurs.
Tissue specificity: Leaves and stems. Lower in roots.
Pharmaceutical use: The uteroactive properties of Kalata have been discovered by African traditional medicine. It is used as an ingredient of a herbal tea to accelerate childbirth.
PTM: Kalata-B1 is a cyclic peptide which contains three disulfide bonds 5-19; 11-21; 14-26."
